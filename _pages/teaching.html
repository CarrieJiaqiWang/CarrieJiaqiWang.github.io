<p>
With over six years of experience as a teaching assistant, I have also pursued training in pedagogy through workshops and independent study. My teaching philosophy integrates both theory and practice, and is grounded in two core principles:

1. Using formative assessment to support student growth

2. Fostering interactive, student-centered classrooms
