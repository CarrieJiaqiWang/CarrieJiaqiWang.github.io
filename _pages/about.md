Hi! I’m a rising fourth-year PhD student at [Cornell Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE)](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/orie/), advised by Prof. [Gennady Samorodnitsky](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/gennady/).

My research lies at the intersection of probability theory and algorithm design, with a focus on extreme events, large deviations, and heavy-tailed phenomena in stochastic systems. In the long term, I aim to integrate probabilistic insights into the design of efficient and reliable algorithms. 

Beyond research, I’m committed to teaching and community building. I’ve served as a TA consultant for Cornell Engineering and co-led mentorship programs supporting underrepresented and low-income applicants. I hold a B.S. in Mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

Beyond Academia 
=====

Outside of research, I enjoy climbing, hiking, and cooking Chinese meals. I’m an avid reader of psychology, biology, and biography—drawn to ideas that connect science with everyday life. I value curiosity, balance, and inner freedom, and believe that a meaningful life is built on diverse anchors: work, relationships, solitude, and exploration.
