Hi! I’m a rising fourth-year PhD student at [Cornell Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE)](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/orie/) department, advised by Prof. [Gennady Samorodnitsky](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/gennady/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of probability theory, optimization, and privacy-preserving algorithms. I’m especially drawn to abnormal probabilistic phenomena—such as heavy-tailed distributions and large deviation events—and their implications in algorithmic design and risk-aware decision making.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about teaching, mentoring, and community building. I believe in cultivating curiosity, encouraging open communication, and supporting the next generation of researchers.

Prior to joining Cornell, I obtained a BS in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the Chinese University of Hongkong (Shenzhen) in 2022.

Personal life 
=====

When I’m not researching, you’ll likely find me climbing, hiking, or playing squash. I also enjoy cooking Chinese dishes, singing while playing the piano, and reading across disciplines—especially psychology, biology, philosophy, and AI.
I believe that creativity, compassion, and curiosity are just as essential in research as they are in life.
